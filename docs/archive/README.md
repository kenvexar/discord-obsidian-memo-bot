## Migration Notes

The legacy documentation was reorganized into a hierarchical structure with the following benefits:

1. **Better Organization**: Documentation is now organized by user type (user, developer, operations)
2. **Improved Navigation**: Clear table of contents and cross-references
3. **Language Consistency**: All documentation standardized to English
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant content across multiple files
5. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to maintain

## New Documentation Structure

The content from these archived files has been integrated into:

- **User Documentation**: [docs/user/](../user/)
- **Developer Documentation**: [docs/developer/](../developer/)
- **Operations Documentation**: [docs/operations/](../operations/)
- **Main Navigation**: [docs-index.md](../docs-index.md)

## Access to Archived Content

If you need to reference specific content from the archived files, they remain available in this directory. However, we recommend using the new documentation structure as it contains the most up-to-date and well-organized information.
